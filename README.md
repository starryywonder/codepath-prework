# Pre-work - *Basic Tip Calculator*

**Basic Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Star Wong**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Live updates tip and total amount as the bill amount is being entered.
- [ ] User can enter custom tip amount. (EXTRA: Tip percentage is calulated and shown below tip amount based on tip input).

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

When entering a new bill amount, the tip and total amount only updates once user has selected a new tip percentage. This can be seen in the beginning of the video walkthrough. I have entered $20.00 in the bill amount prior to recording this.
